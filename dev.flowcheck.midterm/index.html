	<h1>Why <span>Drones</span> are better than Helicopters</h1>
	<h2>-Jack MacKinnon</h2>
	<p>Why are drones better than helicopters? Well drones are better<br>
	than helicopters for a number of reasons. First, they have no risk<br>
	as a crew isn't needed to operate one on board.<br>
	Much less expensive to operate, can be operated indefinitely with batteries,<br>
	Smaller, more outlets for creativity with close proximity to obstacles.</p>

	<h3>But Helicopters Produce Better Footage?</h3>
	<p>Not always the case, larger cameras can be fitted to large drone platforms<br>
	producing helicopter-like shots for a fraction of the cost, risk and time. These<br>
	drones can be carried on-site by backpack, as they are lightweight and easy to set up.<br>
	The drone market is here to stay, and helicopters are becoming more and more obsolete<br>
	in modern day filmaking. Some helicopter capabilities outweigh the drones. Such as speed<br>
	and altitude. But those are improvements that are constantly being pushed in drone technology.<br>
	3 Main reasons drones are better than Helicopters:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Safety</li>
		<li>Versitility</li>
		<li>Consistency</li>
	</ul>
