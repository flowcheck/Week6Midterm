	<h1>Why <span>Helicopters</span> are better than Drones</h1>
	<h2>-Pizzamaster458(Aka Jack MacKinnon)</h2>
	<p>Why are helicopters better than drones? They are able to outmanuver and outrun<br>
	any existing drone in the market, Helicopters are considerably faster than any drone that<br>
	can carry a similar camera payload. They can gain altitude much faster than drones and do manuvers<br>
	simply not possible with traditional drones. That is why there will always be helicopters in cinema<br>
	because a lot of shots need the speed and altitude of a helicopter to achieve the desired look.</p>

	<h3>But Drones are safer?</h3>
	<p>While it is true that drones are safer, the story is larger than that. Helicopters rarely have accidents<br>
	and when they do they are usually survivable. The risk argument is invalid in my opinion. Pilots are much more highly<br>
	qualified in helicopters than drones, leading to an overall very safe track record. The risk does exist, but it is negligible.</p>
